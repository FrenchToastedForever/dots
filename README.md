A super W.I.P hyprland and currently waybar configuration (hoping to expand to the hyprland ecosystem and quickshell)



## Info
- Refer to .config/hyprland/global.conf for default apps opened by keybinds
- All configuration for hyprland is stored in .config/hypr/hyprland

## Install

Theres really no reason to be doing fancy installations for this simple config so simply move the files in .config/ to your config directory!

## Dependencies
See globals.conf to change defaults but by default these packages are used optionally:
```bash
#Arch install optional deps
#In progress does not cover all deps atm
sudo pacman -S --needed hypr waybar adw-gtk-theme sddm polkit easyeffects
```
