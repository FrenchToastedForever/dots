A super W.I.P hyprland and currently waybar configuration (hoping to expand to the hyprland ecosystem and quickshell)



## Info
- Refer to .config/hyprland/global.conf for default apps opened by keybinds
- All configuration for hyprland is stored in .config/hypr/hyprland
## Install

Theres really no reason to be doing fancy installations for this simple config so simply move the files in .config/ to your config directory!
## Acknowledgements
